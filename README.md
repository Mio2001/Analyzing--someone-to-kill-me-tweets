# Analyzing Suicidal Tweets 

## Introduction
This code is for my senior thesis project to graduate from Waseda University in the year 2023. The thesis is titled "Exploring Suicidal Expression in Online Spaces: An Ethical Analysis on Emotion Prediction and Suicide-Related Content on Social Media." The aim was to shed light on suicideal ideation and expressions of self-harm on social media, with a primary focus on Twitter. The project examines the emotional reactions of users to tweets containing the phrase "殺してくれる人" (*koroshitekureru hito* - someone to kill me) by employing emotion mining techniques.
